       <pre><h2>    American Airlines flies to 269 domestic destinations and 81 international destinations in 48 countries (as of January 2022).
The list includes the city, country,and the airport's name,with the airline's hubs, seasonal destinations, and previously served destinations
marked where applicable. This list does not include airports served by only American Eagle,the airline's regional hub transport brand.
American Airlines walk on ticketing has small 1000 seat and larger 850,000 or more seat aircraft available with CRM on demand
but also reservations and cargo services available.</h2>

           <h2>Air India flies to the following destinations as of October 2021. This list does not contain destinations served by
subsidiaries Air India Express or Alliance Air. For the destinations which were earlier served by Air India, go to the Air India timeline.</h2>

<h2>The airline operates to 103 destinations with international flights to 45 cities in 31 countries and domestic flights to 58 cities.
Flight planning is the process of producing a flight plan to describe a proposed aircraft flight. It involves two safety-critical aspects:
fuel calculation, to ensure that the aircraft can safely reach the destination, and compliance with air traffic control requirements,
to minimise the risk of midair collision. In addition, flight planners normally wish to minimise flight cost through the appropriate choice
of route, height, and speed, and by loading the minimum necessary fuel on board. Air Traffic Services (ATS) use the completed flight plan for
separation of aircraft in air traffic management services, including tracking and finding lost aircraft, during search and rescue missions.</h2>

    <h2 style="color:white;">  Flight planning requires accurate weather forecasts so that fuel consumption calculations can account for
the fuel consumption effects of head or tail winds and air temperature. Safety regulations require aircraft to carry fuel beyond the
minimum needed to fly from origin to destination, allowing for unforeseen circumstances or for diversion to another airport if the
planned destination becomes unavailable. Furthermore, under the supervision of air traffic control, aircraft flying in controlled airspace
must follow predetermined routes known as airways (at least where they have been defined), even if such routes are not as economical as a
more direct flight. Within these airways, aircraft must maintain flight levels, specified altitudes usually separated vertically by 1,000
or 2,000 ft (300 or 610 m),depending on the route being flown and the direction of travel. When aircraft with only two engines are flying
long distances across oceans, deserts, or other areas with no airports, they have to satisfy additional ETOPS safety rules to ensure they
can reach an emergency airport if one engine fails.</h2>
<h2>    Producing an accurate optimised flight plan requires millions of calculations, so commercial flight planning systems make extensive
use of computers (an approximate unoptimised flight plan can be produced using an E6B and a map in an hour or so, but more allowance must
be made for unforeseen circumstances). When computer flight planning replaced manual flight planning for eastbound flights across the
North Atlantic, the average fuel consumption was reduced by about 450 kg (1,000 lb) per flight, and the average flight times were reduced
by about 5 minutes per flight. Some commercial airlines have their own internal flight planning system,
while others employ the services of external planners.</h2></pre>
